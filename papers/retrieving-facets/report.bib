It applied eye tracking, stimulated recall interviews, and direct observation to investigate important aspects of gaze behavior in a faceted search interface: what components of the interface searchers looked at, for how long, and in what order. It yielded empirical data that will be useful for both practitioners (e.g., for improving search interface designs), and researchers (e.g., to inform models of search behavior). Results of the study show that participants spent about 50 seconds per task looking at (fixating on) the results, about 25 seconds looking at the facets, and only about 6 seconds looking at the query itself. These findings suggest that facets played an important role in the exploratory search process.},

    abstract = {Statistical language models have been successfully applied to many information retrieval tasks, including expert finding: the process of identifying experts given a particular topic. In this paper, we introduce and detail language modeling approaches that integrate the representation, association and search of experts using various textual data sources into a generative probabilistic framework. This provides a simple, intuitive, and extensible theoretical framework to underpin research into expertise search. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, two search strategies to find experts are modeled that incorporate different types of evidence extracted from the data, before being extended to also incorporate co-occurrence information. The models proposed are evaluated in the context of enterprise search systems within an intranet environment, where it is reasonable to assume that the list of experts is known, and that data to be mined is publicly accessible. Our experiments show that excellent performance can be achieved by using these models in such environments, and that this theoretical and empirical work paves the way for future principled extensions.},

@article{zhai2004study,
    abstract = {Language modeling approaches to information retrieval are attractive and promising because they connect the problem of retrieval with that of language model estimation, which has been studied extensively in other application areas such as speech recognition. The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and to then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A central issue in language model estimation is  smoothing , the problem of adjusting the maximum likelihood estimator to compensate for data sparseness. In this article, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections. Experimental results show that not only is the retrieval performance generally sensitive to the smoothing parameters, but also the sensitivity pattern is affected by the query type, with performance being more sensitive to smoothing for verbose queries than for keyword queries. Verbose queries also generally require more aggressive smoothing to achieve optimal performance. This suggests that smoothing plays two different role---to make the estimated document language model more accurate and to "explain" the noninformative words in the query. In order to decouple these two distinct roles of smoothing, we propose a two-stage smoothing strategy, which yields better sensitivity patterns and facilitates the setting of smoothing parameters automatically. We further propose methods for estimating the smoothing parameters automatically. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.},

Our first extension adds exible, dynamic business intelligence aggregations to the faceted application, enabling users to gain insight into their data that is far richer than just knowing the quantities of documents belonging to each facet. We see this capability as a step toward bringing OLAP capabilities, traditionally supported by databases over relational data, to the domain of free-text queries over metadata-rich content. Our second extension shows how one can efficiently extend a faceted search engine to support correlated facets - a more complex information model in which the values associated with a document across multiple facets are not independent. We show that by reducing the problem to a recently solved tree-indexing scenario, data with correlated facets can be efficiently indexed and retrieved},

Subject headings inherited from card catalogs are useful but limited, while full-text indexing is most appropriate for readers who already know exactly what they want. Statistical topic models provide a complementary function. These models can identify semantically coherent "topics" that are easily recognizable and meaningful to humans, but they have been too computationally intensive to run on library-scale corpora. This paper presents DCM-LDA, a topic model based on Dirichlet Compound Multinomial distributions. This model is simultaneously better able to represent observed properties of text and more scalable to extremely large text collections. We train individual topic models for each book based on the cooccurrence of words within pages. We then cluster topics across books. The resulting topical clusters can be interpreted as subject facets, allowing readers to browse the topics of a collection quickly, find relevant books using topically expanded keyword searches, and explore topical relationships between books. We demonstrate this method finding topics on a corpus of 1.49 billion words from 42,000 books in less than 20 hours, and it easily could scale well beyond this.},

Facets are selected based on their ability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples, as well as on the ability of the user to provide desired values for them. Our facet selection algorithms also work in conjunction with any ranked retrieval model where a ranking function imposes a bias over the user preferences for the selected tuples.

However, in many cases, like in medical applications, the ontologies may be very large and complex, and do not provide the end-user with intuitive facet hierarchies for conceptualizing the content, for formulating queries, and for classifying the search results. We argue that in such cases end-user facets should be separated from the annotation ontologies, and show how to generalize the semantic view-based search paradigm to take into account this fact. A user-centric card sorting method is proposed for designing intuitive views for the end-users and a method for mapping its facets onto the indexing ontologies and search items is presented. The system has been implemented in a prototype of the semantic portal TerveSuomi.fi, a national health promotion portal in Finland.},

A usability study, in which 32 art history students explored a collection of 35,000 fine arts images, compares this approach to a standard image search interface. Despite the unfamiliarity and power of the interface (attributes that often lead to rejection of new search interfaces), the study results show that 90\% of the participants preferred the metadata approach overall, 97\% said that it helped them learn more about the collection, 75\% found it more flexible, and 72\% found it easier to use than a standard baseline system.

However, feedback, as one important component in a retrieval system, has only been dealt with heuristically in this new retrieval approach: the original query is usually literally expanded by adding additional terms to it. Such  expansion-based  feedback creates an inconsistent interpretation of the original and the expanded query. In this paper, we present a more principled approach to feedback in the language modeling approach. Specifically, we treat feedback as updating the query language model based on the extra evidence carried by the feedback documents. Such a  model-based  feedback strategy easily fits into an extension of the language modeling approach. We propose and evaluate two different approaches to updating a query language model based on feedback documents, one based on a generative probabilistic model of feedback documents and one based on minimization of the KL-divergence over feedback documents. Experiment results show that both approaches are effective and outperform the Rocchio feedback approach.},
