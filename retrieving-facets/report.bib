    abstract = {This study examined how searchers interacted with a web-based, faceted library catalog when conducting exploratory searches. It applied eye tracking, stimulated recall interviews, and direct observation to investigate important aspects of gaze behavior in a faceted search interface: what components of the interface searchers looked at, for how long, and in what order. It yielded empirical data that will be useful for both practitioners (e.g., for improving search interface designs), and researchers (e.g., to inform models of search behavior). Results of the study show that participants spent about 50 seconds per task looking at (fixating on) the results, about 25 seconds looking at the facets, and only about 6 seconds looking at the query itself. These findings suggest that facets played an important role in the exploratory search process.},

    abstract = {Statistical language models have been successfully applied to many information retrieval tasks, including expert finding: the process of identifying experts given a particular topic. In this paper, we introduce and detail language modeling approaches that integrate the representation, association and search of experts using various textual data sources into a generative probabilistic framework. This provides a simple, intuitive, and extensible theoretical framework to underpin research into expertise search. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, two search strategies to find experts are modeled that incorporate different types of evidence extracted from the data, before being extended to also incorporate co-occurrence information. The models proposed are evaluated in the context of enterprise search systems within an intranet environment, where it is reasonable to assume that the list of experts is known, and that data to be mined is publicly accessible. Our experiments show that excellent performance can be achieved by using these models in such environments, and that this theoretical and empirical work paves the way for future principled extensions.},
