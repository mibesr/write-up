% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V1.9 April 2009
% This file should be compiled with V2.4 of "sig-alternate.cls" April 2009
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.4 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.4) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{Approximate Query-Dependent Facet Retrieval}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.
